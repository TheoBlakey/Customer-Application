# Customer Application built by Theodore Blakey

## Application functions:
Creates a customer table from hard-coded data of example customers.
Edit Dialog appears when customer table row or “EDIT” button is clicked.
Add Dialog appears when “Add New customer” button is clicked.
Using the dialogs, customer data can be changed and added via the “OK” button.  This button is disabled if the validation on the inputs is not passed.

App.tsx and App.css are the main files I have worked on to build this application.
